# printsounds
tool to parse rust's logfile
pretty cool, make sure the key you bound to audio.printsounds is the same as the key you provide to the program.
also make sure that your rust is in the default directory, otherwise just change the directory and run the code.

highly recommended to make branches or pull requests to add features
